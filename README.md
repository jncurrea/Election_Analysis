# Election Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
Used Python to write algorithms that will assist the confirmation and analysis of election results. In this election we had 3 candidates, Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane. Also we had the participation of 3 counties, Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe.

## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used in any election given the fact that it contains the logic of how to implement new modifications is desired. Two examples of this are the following, first, adding an iterator in order to count votes per city, given the fact that cities are not included in the code. A second exampele can be adding an algorithm that performs this same process recursively if there is a need of a second round of votes for two candidates.
